### Description

This application uses a sql database to track burgers that the user either want's to eat or has eaten. Node is used on the backend to make API requests to and from the server. This allows the app to read, create, and update new data to the database.

### Installation

After the repo is cloned, an npm install will need to be run to get all of the package dependencies. From there a sql database will need to be created from the schema file from within. After that the app should be able to run.
